For increment A-More-OOP, ChatGPT was used for providing the advice on implementations of Storage.java, Ui.java and TaskList.java.

For increment A-JUnit, I was stuck at running "gradlew clean test" command for almost one day because it always printed the error message. With the help of ChatGPT, I found the problem was with the naming of my working directory. I followed its suggestion of replacing Chinese characters with English words, and finally it worked.

For increment A-CodeQuality, I asked ChatGPT for help to apply SLAP to shorten long methods in Task.java, MarkCommand.java and UnmarkCommand.java.
